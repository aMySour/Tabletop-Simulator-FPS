# FPS Unity Project

This is the Unity project for my FPS Kit. It uses Unity 2019.4.40f1.

You can build this using `Assets` > `Build AssetBundles`, which will add `.unity3d` files to the `AssetBundles` folder. You can then add these in-game.

You're recommend to simply update the URLs on existing FPS Player and FPS Screen objects instead of recreating them, as you'll otherwise have to set the size, tags and script again.
